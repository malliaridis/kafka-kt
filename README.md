# kafka-kt

This is an unofficial and experimental Kotlin migration of the
[Apache kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) project.

> **CAUTION:** The migration is in very early stage and has very likely multiple bugs. **It is not
> recommended to use it in the current state.**

## Migration Status

The [milestones on GitHub](https://github.com/malliaridis/kafka-kt/milestones) show the current progress
of the migration. Right now the following modules have been fully migrated (but not yet optimized):

- `clients` (Kafka 3.6.0)
- `generator` (Kafka 3.6.0)
- `server-common` (Kafka 3.6.0)
